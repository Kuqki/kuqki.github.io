        <p><strong>The more sophisticated socieies became, the better they could influence desiable occurences through ritualized theater.</strong><br>.<br>In seeking to describe the origins of theater, one must rely primarily on speculation, since there is little concrete evidence on which to draw. The most widely accepted theory, championed by anthropologists in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, envisions theater as emerging out of myth and ritual. The process perceived by these anthropologists may be summarized briefly. During the early stages of its development, a society becomes aware of forces that appear to influence or control its food supply and well-being. Having little understanding of natural causes, it attributes both desirable and undesirable occurrences to supernatural or magical forces, and it searches for means to win the favor of these forces. Perceiving an apparent connection between certain actions performed by the group and the result it desires, the group repeats, refines, and formalizes those actions into fixed ceremonies, or rituals.</p>
<p><img src="/asset/1280px-Taormina_BW_2012-10-05_16-05-05.jpg" alt="Greek theatre in Taormina, Sicily"></p>
<p>Stories (myths) may then grow up around a ritual. Frequently the myths include representatives of hose supernatural forces that the rites celebrate or hope to influence. Performers may wear costumes and masks to represent the mythical characters or supernatural forces in the rituals or in accompanying celebrations. As a people becomes more sophisticated, its conceptions of supernatural forces and causal relationships nay change. As a result, it may abandon or modify some rites. But the myths that have grown up around the rites may continue as part of the group — oral tradition and may even come to acted out under conditions divorced from these rites. When this occurs, the first step has been taken toward theater as an autonomous activity, and thereafter entertainment and aesthetic values may gradually replace the former mystical and socially efficacious concerns.</p>
<p>Although origin in ritual as long been the most popular, it is by no means the only theory about how the theater came into being. Storytelling has been proposed as one alternative. Under this theory, relating and listening to stories are seen as fundamental human pleasures. Thus, the recalling of an event (a hunt, battle, or other feat) is elaborated through the narrator抯 pantomime and impersonation and eventually through each role being assumed by a different person.</p>
<p><strong>Theater may have come from pleasure humans receive from storytelling and moving rhythmically.</strong><br>.<br>A closely related theory sees theater as evolving out of dances that are primarily pantomimic, rhythmical or gymnastic, or from imitations if animal noises and sounds. Admiration for the performer — skill, virtuosity, and grace are seen as motivation for elaborating the activities into fully realized theatrical performances.</p>
<p>In addition to exploring the possible antecedents of theater, scholars have also theorized about the motives that led people to develop theater. Why did the theater develop, and why was it valued after it ceased to fulfill the function of ritual? Most answers fall back on the theories about the human mind and basic human needs. One, set forth by Arustotle in the fourth century B.C., sees humans as naturally imitative — as taking pleasure in imitating persons, things, and actions and in seeing such imitations. Another, advanced in the twentieth century, suggests that humans have a gift for fantasy, through which they seek to reshape reality into more satisfying forms than those encountered in daily life. Thus, fantasy r fiction (of which drama is one form) permits people to objectify their anxieties and fears, confront them, and fulfill their hopes in fiction if not fact. The theater, then, is one tool whereby people define and understand their world or escape from unpleasant realities.</p>

<p><strong>The human capacities for imitation and fantasy are considered possible reasons why societies develop theater.</strong><br>.<br>But neither the human imitative instinct nor a penchant for fantasy by itself leads to an autonomous theater. Therefore, additional explanations are needed. One necessary condition seems to be a somewhat detached view of human problems. For example, one sign of this condition is the appearance of the comic vision, since comedy requires sufficient detachment to view some deviations from social norms as ridiculous rather than as serious threats to the welfare of the entire group. Another condition that contributes to the development of autonomous theater is the emergence of the aesthetic sense. For example, some early societies ceased to consider certain rites essential to their well-being and abandoned them; nevertheless, they retained as parts of their oral tradition the myths that had grown up around the rites and admired them for their artistic qualities rather than for their religious usefulness.</p>

        <p><strong>Research has shown that certain minerals are required by plants</strong> for normal growth and development The soil is the source of these minerals which are absorbed by the plant with the water from the soil Even nitrogen, which is a gas in its elemental state, is normally absorbed from the soil as nitrate ions Some soils are notoriously deficient in micro nutrients and are therefore unable to support most plant life So-called serpentine soils, for example, are deficient in calcium, and only plants able to tolerate low levels of this mineral can survive In modern agriculture, mineral depletion of soils is a major concern, since harvesting crops interrupts the recycling of nutrients back to the soil.<br>.</p>
<h2 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h2><p>Mineral deficiencies can often be detected by specific symptoms such as chlorosis {loss of chlorophyll resulting in yellow or white leaf tissue), necrosis (isolated dead patches), anthocyanin formation (development of deep red pigmentation of leaves or stem), stunted growth, and development of woody tissue in an herbaceous plant Soils are most commonly deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus. Nitrogen-deficient plants exhibit many of the symptoms just described Leaves develop chlorosis, stems are short and slender, and anthocyanin discoloration occurs on stems, petioles, and lower leaf surfaces Phosphorus-deficient plants are often stunted, with leaves turning a characteristic dark green, often with the accumulation of anthocyanin. Typically, older leaves are affected first as the phosphorus is mobilized to young growing tissue Iron deficiency is characterized by chlorosis between veins in young leaves.</p>
<p>Much of the research on nutrient deficiencies is based on growing plants hydroponically. that is. in soilless liquid nutrient solutions This technique allows researchers to create solutions that selectively omit certain nutrients and then observe the resulting effects on the plants Hydroponics has applications beyond basic research, since it facilitates the growing of greenhouse vegetables during winter. Aeroponics, a technique in which plants are suspended and the roots misted with a nutrient solution, is another method for growing plants without soil.</p>
<p>While mineral deficiencies can limit the growth of plants. an overabundance of certain minerals can be toxic and can also limit growth Saline soils, which have high concentrations of sodium chloride and other salts, limit plant growth, and research continues to focus on developing salt-tolerant varieties of agricultural crops Research has focused on the toxic effects of heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and aluminum however, even copper and zinc, which are essential elements, can become toxic in high concentrations Although most plants cannot survive in these soils, certain plants have the ability to tolerate high levels of these minerals.<br>Scientists have known for some time that certain plants, called hyperaccumulators. can concentrate minerals at levels a hundredfold or greater than normal. A survey of known hyperaccumulators identified that 75 percent of them amassed nickel; cobalt, copper, zinc, manganese, lead, and cadmium are other minerals of choice. </p>
<p>Hyperaccumulators run the entire range of the plant world. They may be herbs shrubs, or trees. Many members of the mustard family, spurge family, legume family and grass family are top hyperaccumulators Many are found in tropical and subtropical areas of the world, where accumulation of high concentrations of metals may afford some protection against plant-eating insects and microbial pathogens.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Only recently have investigators considered using these plants to clean up soil and waste sites that have been contaminated by toxic levels of heavy metals - an environmentally friendly approach known as phytore mediation This scenario begins with the planting of hyperaccumulating species in the target area such as an abandoned mine or an irrigation pond contaminated by runoff Toxic minerals would first be absorbed by roots but later relocated to the stem and leaves A harvest of the shoots would remove the toxic compounds off site to be burned or composted to recover the metal for industrial uses After several years of cultivation and harvest, the site would be restored at a cost much lower than the price of excavation and reburial the standard practice for remediation of contaminated soils For example, in field trials, the plant alpine pennycress removed zinc and cadmium from soils near a zinc smelter, and Indian mustard, native to Pakistan and India has been effective in reducing levels of selenium salts by 50 percent in contaminated soils.</p>
